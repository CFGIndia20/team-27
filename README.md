In our project we aim to tackle a problem involving the automation of teacher assignment for slots as well as an online portal for sucessful placements of the students of
the NGO Nudge. The selection of teachers for slots involves an algorithm with parameters such as : teachers not to be assigned consecutive slots, neither for them to have 
more than an 8 hour work day, hence ensuring sustainability. Our algorithm breaks the complexity down into database queries. We have an 
inclusive system for verification of the student's basic identities currently required such as proof of age and education up till the 12th grade. 
A student gets to apply to the platform and on verification has the liberty to choose any of the available slots. 
All attendance for batches belonging to a teacher can be taken on the platform as well.
 The administration of the NGO will have powers to shift all processes to the web application may it be Verification of minimal proof, creating of slots as per demand and 
also an effective system which will automate the fair distribution of slots amongst teachers. The important task of substitution of slots, as frequently required in a 
teaching environment for substitution is also a use case of our system where teachers will be able to log in requests which will result in admins getting the best possible
options for replacment while maintaining teacher constraints. 
 
The admin power is extended to the job portal where they can update new jobs only accessible to students who have completed the course with a satisfactory attendance rate.
A job is associated with certain skills that an employer is looking for. Students can apply to the jobs after which admins get an option to filter students on the factor
of candidates who possess more relevant skills to the job. 

Tech Stack used:
Node.js Express Mongodb and Angular.js to build a web application

Future Scope
To implement a waitlist system so that admin can be suggested by the system itself as to which slots are more in demand.
The system can be made more scalable by implementing Container orchastration.
